I made this site mostly to house quick kubectl snippets that I find myself using a lot but can never remember. I hope you enjoy!

## Contributing

I'm more than happy to accept Pull Requests for improvements on commands or new ones that are useful. I try to follow these basic guidelines:

- Shouldn't be something someone would learn in a typical one hour "Intro to Kubernetes"
- Should be useful for the vast majority of cluster setups, not a specific tool or hosting provider
- Shouldn't use external tools unless absolutely necessary (avoid xargs, jq, sed, awk, etc.)
- Should fit on one line of about 180 characters
